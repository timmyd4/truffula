#Truffula

A fun project done in class at GRC (Green River College). This project prints a directory tree in a vertical, colorful format.

It uses built-in Java utilities like Color, file manipulation, and data structures such as List and Array.

This project was part of Week 12 of my second quarter at GRC, during which we focused on data structures and commonly used algorithms.
